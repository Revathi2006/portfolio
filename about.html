                   I am a dedicated B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with a strong passion for full stack web development. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in AI, machine learning, data analysis, and programming, while my hands-on projects have allowed me to translate theoretical knowledge into practical applications.

I particularly enjoy designing and building web applications that solve real-world problems. For instance, in my projects PulseCare and Revia, I applied my technical expertise and problem-solving skills to develop user-focused solutions. These projects not only enhanced my proficiency in frontend and backend development but also strengthened my ability to integrate AI-driven features, manage databases, and optimize user experience.

I am committed to continuous learning, staying up-to-date with modern web technologies such as React, Node.js, Firebase, and RESTful APIs, while exploring ways to incorporate AI and data analytics into scalable web solutions. My goal is to leverage my knowledge of AI, data science, and web development to create efficient, innovative, and impactful applications.

As an aspiring full stack developer, I am actively seeking a full stack development internship where I can gain real-world experience, contribute meaningfully to innovative projects, and further develop my skills as a versatile software professional. I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy tackling challenging problems, and am eager to make a tangible impact through technology.
